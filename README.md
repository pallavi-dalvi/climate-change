# climate-change

Introduction:

In this project, I have created a story around Climate change crisis with the help of analysis of CO2 emissions , Sea level impact and temperature change.

The flow of the project is as follows.

Analyse world temperate change and related factors -->Analyse how each continent is affected --> How Asia is leading in CO2 emissions --> Detailed Analysis of Asian countries China and Maldives 

The real challenge for this project was data collection. I retrieved the data from multiple sources such as Data World, NASA Database . 
Data cleaning along with consolidation is performed using python.

Data visualisation and Story creation is done in Tableau.
